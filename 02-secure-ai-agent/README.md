# 2. Secure an AI Agent That Can Take Actions

A chatbot produces text. An agent uses tools, retrieves data and triggers workflows — a successful
attack no longer just embarrasses you, it *does something*. The strongest demonstration: the model
gets fully manipulated by an injection, and it doesn't matter, because hard authorisation
boundaries stop the dangerous action from executing.

## Business Scenario

An internal agent for "Northwind Retail" IT support with three tools: read support documents,
create a service ticket, and query a fictional asset inventory.

## Architecture — Before (Insecure Design)

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    Doc[/Support Document\ncontains injected\ninstructions/] --> Agent
    User([User]) -->|task| Agent["Agent\n(uses the user's own identity)\nno tool restrictions"]
    Agent -->|reads| Tool1[Read Docs Tool]
    Agent -->|unrestricted| Tool2[Create Ticket Tool]
    Agent -->|unrestricted| Tool3[Asset Inventory Tool]
    Tool3 -->|accesses restricted file| Restricted[(Restricted Asset\nData)]

    style Doc fill:#3a1414,stroke:#c0392b,color:#fff
    style Restricted fill:#3a1414,stroke:#c0392b,color:#fff
```

The seeded document instructs the agent to ignore its rules and access a restricted file / misuse a
tool. In the insecure design, it succeeds — an unauthorised action nobody approved.

## Architecture — After (Hardened Design)

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    Doc[/Support Document\nlabeled UNTRUSTED/] -->|input trust label| Agent
    User([User]) -->|task| IdentityCheck["Agent Identity\n(distinct from user,\nattributable)"]
    IdentityCheck --> Agent[Agent]
    Agent -->|allow-listed only| Gate{Tool Gateway\nresource-level\npermissions,\nleast privilege}
    Gate -->|scoped, short-lived\ncredential| Tool1[Read Docs Tool]
    Gate -->|scoped, short-lived\ncredential| Tool2[Create Ticket Tool]
    Gate -.->|BLOCKED:\nnot in allow-list\nfor this task| Tool3[Asset Inventory Tool]
    Gate -->|high-impact action| HITL[Human-in-the-loop\napproval]
    Gate --> Log[(Tool-call Log\nfor auditability)]
    Kill[[Emergency\nRevocation]] -.->|instantly kills access| Gate

    style Doc fill:#3a2a14,stroke:#e67e22,color:#fff
    style Tool3 fill:#3a1414,stroke:#c0392b,color:#fff,stroke-dasharray: 5 5
```

## Attack

Seed one document read by the agent with an **indirect prompt injection** instructing it to ignore
its rules and access the restricted asset file or misuse the ticket tool. Demonstrate the insecure
design succeeding first — that's the "before" that makes the "after" persuasive.

## Hardened Controls

- Dedicated agent identity, distinct from the user, so actions are attributable and governable
- Allow-list of tools and resource-level permissions — least privilege
- Short-lived, scoped credentials rather than standing access
- Human-in-the-loop approval for high-impact actions
- Input trust labels marking retrieved/tool-returned content as untrusted
- Complete tool-call logging for auditability
- Emergency revocation mechanism to kill the agent's access instantly

## Portfolio Checklist

- [ ] Insecure agent implementation + demonstrated exploit (screenshot/log of unauthorised action)
- [ ] Hardened agent implementation with all seven controls above
- [ ] Architecture diagrams (before/after, above)
- [ ] Permission policy / allow-list definition
- [ ] Retest evidence: same injection, model still fooled, action still blocked
- [ ] Written report + short demo + one-page executive summary
